# EPFL Equal Labs

Single page web application developed with Python Dash to view the gender distribution of research staff at EPFL labs.

### Data 

The data on the lab research staff was manually collected from the lab websites in June 2021. There may be inaccuracies in the data depending on how often a lab website is updated. Administrative or non-technical staff, guest researchers and student researchers are not counted as research staff.

### View 

The web application is currently running at https://equallabsepfl.pythonanywhere.com/, using the [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) hosting service. 

### Run locally
